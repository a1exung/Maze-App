O(n)^2 because we have a segment of code where there is a for loop nested into a while loop. To find the big oh notation of the algorithms, we must add up the big oh notation of each individual segment. Doing this, we then just take the largest value since at really large values of n the rest is irrelevant. Doing this, we see that the only value is O(n)^2 since there is a for loop of add nested into the while loop of solve for each step.
